        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Heartier than soup but different than a traditional chili, this is fun to serve at a party, take along to a tailgate, or bring to a potluck. Ground chicken instead of beef and white beans instead of chili beans make up the base of this chili. Flavor from the chicken broth, ranch dressing mix, and fire-roasted tomatoes (along with the heat from the buffalo sauce) are balanced out with sweet corn and cream cheese. Top it off with fresh cilantro and blue cheese crumbles for the final touch.</p>
