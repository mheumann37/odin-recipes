        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Cumin is not typically found in Chinese cuisine. But in Hunan province, which is known for its spice-forward foods, the earthy-tasting seed adds its flavor to this popular beef dish, mingling with more traditional ingredients like soy sauce and garlic. Together, it all adds up to something complex and satisfying—with waves of chili heat, fragrant aromatics, and a deeply savory backbone.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Ground Beef, 10 ounces</li>
                <li>Garlic, 2 cloves</li>
                <li>Sesame Oil, 1 teaspoon</li>
                <li>Chili Flakes, 1 teaspoon</li>
                <li>Yellow Onion, 1 unit</li>
                <li>Sesame Seeds, 1 tablespoon</li>
                <li>Lime, 1 unit</li>
                <li>Ginger, 1 thumb</li>
                <li>Soy Sauce, 1 tablespoon</li>
                <li>Cumin Seeds, 1 teaspoon</li>
                <li>Cilantro, 1/4 ounce</li>
                <li>Shredded Red Cabbage, 8 ounces</li>
                <li>Jasmine Rice, 3/4 cup</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Wash and dry all produce. Preheat broiler to high or oven to 500 degrees. Bring 1¼ cups water to a boil in a small pot. Halve, peel, and thinly slice onion. Mince or grate garlic. Peel, then mince ginger until you have 2 TBSP. Halve lime.</li>
                <li>Once water is boiling, add rice to pot. Cover, lower heat, and reduce to a simmer. Cook until tender, 15-20 minutes. Remove from heat and keep covered until rest of meal is ready.</li>
                <li>Heat a drizzle of oil in a large pan over medium-high heat. Add onion and cook, tossing, until softened, 3-4 minutes. Stir in garlic, ginger, 1 tsp cumin seeds (we sent more), and a pinch of chili flakes (to taste). Cook until softened and fragrant, 2-3 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
                <li>While onions cook, toss cabbage on a baking sheet with a drizzle of oil and a pinch of salt and pepper. Broil (or bake) until lightly browned and crispy at edges, 8-12 minutes. TIP: Keep an eye on the cabbage to make sure it does not burn.</li>
                <li>Add beef to pan with onions. Break up meat into pieces with a spatula or wooden spoon. Cook, tossing occasionally, until no longer pink and slightly browned at edges, about 5 minutes. Stir in soy sauce and ½ tsp sugar. Remove pan from heat, then stir in a squeeze of lime and 1 tsp sesame oil. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
                <li>Divide rice between plates and top with cabbage and beef mixture. Sprinkle with sesame seeds, lime juice, and any remaining chili flakes (to taste). Tear cilantro leaves over top and serve.</li>
            </ol>
