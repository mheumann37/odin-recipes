        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>We are always up for a sweet and savory dinner pairing, and these tacos are just that. Ground pork and green pepper are cooked in a sweet soy glaze until sticky and tender. They are stuffed into steamy tortillas, along with a tangy, cilantro-flecked cabbage slaw. Of course, we would never skip out on taco toppings, and these ones do not disappoint: There is creamy, spicy Sriracha mayo and crispy fried onions. It is all ready in just 15 minutesâ€”life is sweet (and savory), friends.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Cilantro, 1/4 ounce</li>
                <li>Rice Wine Vinegar, 5 teaspoons</li>
                <li>Ground Pork, 10 ounces</li>
                <li>Mayonnaise, 2 tablespoons</li>
                <li>Flour Tortilla, 6 units</li>
                <li>Coleslaw Mix, 4 ounces</li>
                <li>Long Green Pepper, 1 unit</li>
                <li>Sweet Soy Glaze, 4 tablespoons</li>
                <li>Sriracha, 1 teaspoon</li>
                <li>Crispy Fried Onions, 1 unit</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Wash and dry produce. Roughly chop cilantro. Halve, core, and thinly slice green pepper. In a medium bowl, toss together coleslaw mix, half the vinegar (all for 4 servings), half the cilantro, 1 tsp sugar (2 tsp for 4), and a pinch of salt until thoroughly combined.</li>
                <li>Heat a drizzle of oil in a large pan over medium-high heat. Add green pepper and cook until slightly softened, 2-3 minutes. Add pork and season with salt and pepper. Cook, breaking up meat into pieces, until browned and cooked through, 4-6 minutes. Stir in sweet soy glaze; cook until everything is coated and glaze has thickened, 1-2 minutes. Remove pan from heat.</li>
                <li>Meanwhile, in a small bowl, combine mayonnaise with Sriracha to taste. Season with salt and pepper. Wrap tortillas in damp paper towels and microwave until warm and pliable, 30 seconds.</li>
                <li>Divide tortillas between plates and fill with pork mixture and slaw (draining first). Top with Sriracha mayo, crispy fried onions, and remaining cilantro. Serve.</li>
