The Odin Project - HTML Foundations - Recipes Project

I built a basic recipes website to practice the HTML knowledge I acquired from The Odin Project's foundations course. My project consists of a main index with links to three recipe pages.

Assembling these pages reinforced my understanding of HTML boilerplate along with various elements and tags. Paragraphs and headings segmented text-based data on my web pages while indenting nested elements upheld a similar organizational approach in my code. Ordered and unordered lists structured text to make it easily digestible. Links formed the basic navigational framework between web pages, and images added a visual appeal to the recipe information. 

I also learned the importance of good commit messages, how to write them, when to commit, and why having a history of good commits is so important.

Basic CSS syntax and selectors added style to the structure of my web pages. Specificity, inheritance, and rule order determined how the cascade applied these styles to the HTML. The size and placement of various elements were tailored through the box model by adjusting their margins, borders, and padding. A basic overview of Chrome DevTools provided additional information about various elements and their CSS rules. This insight helped me find and fix problems in my code.
