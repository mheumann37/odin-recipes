The Odin Project - HTML Foundations - Recipes Project

I built a basic recipes website to practice the HTML knowledge I acquired from The Odin Project's foundations course. My project consists of a main index with links to three recipe pages.

Assembling these pages reinforced my understanding of HTML boilerplate along with various elements and tags. Paragraphs and headings segmented text-based data on my webpages while indenting nested elements upheld a similar organizational approach in my code. Ordered and unordered lists structured text to make it easily digestible. Links formed the basic navigational framework between webpages, and images added a visual appeal to the recipe information. 

I also learned the importance of good commit messages, how to write them, when to commit, and why having a history of good commits is so important.
